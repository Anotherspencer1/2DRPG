# 2DRPG

This is a simple top down 2DRPG. The player uses WASD to control the player and can attack with space bar. Enemies slowly move towards the Player

I designed this game to learn unity and practice some basic 2D game developement.

Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the game being played and a walkthrough of the code.
